# Some Processing3 (Java mode) experiments

The ones without author-comments are based on [Rainbow-Code's lessons](https://github.com/CodingTrain/Rainbow-Code) with own modifications. If you want to check up him, info below:

Though he created his 2D stuff with [p5.js](https://p5js.org) and the 3D ones with Processing3, I'm now experimenting with the latter, so in this repo, all the stuff is with Java moded Processing.
